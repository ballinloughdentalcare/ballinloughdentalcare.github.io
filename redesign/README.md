# Redesign of ballinloughdentalcare.ie

The plan here is to port the HTML5-Up inspired style to a more modern CSS
style, streamline the build of the static site (such that it can be easily run
in GitHub Actions and deployed to GitHub Pages), with commonly modifiable
content editable by members of the project from the site itself.
