treatment of a wide variety of conditions, disorders and
diseases affecting the teeth, gums and maxillofacial
(associated with the jaw and face) region of the body.</p><p>General dentists provide services related to the general
maintenance of oral hygiene and tooth health.</p><p>Ideally, dentistry is preventative. We recommend that you
visit your dentist regularly &ndash; at least once every 6-12
months &ndash; to ensure proper oral hygiene and functionality.
Regular checkups and oral health maintenance prevent the
development of serious dental problems that can require
costly treatment. If you remain vigilant and visit your
dentist regularly, you can enjoy exceptional dental health.</p><h4>Gum Disease Treatment</h4><p><span class="image right"><img src="images/gum-treatment.jpg"></span>Gum disease (gingivitis) is chronic inflammation of the gum tissue
(gingiva). Typically associated with poor oral hygiene,
gingivitis is the early stage of periodontitis. Many people are
not even be aware that they have gingivitis, because it is
usually not painful. Periodontitis is an inflammatory
condition affecting the tissues surrounding a tooth, and is
the leading cause of tooth loss. There are a number of
causes of gum disease, each of which can be corrected and
controlled.</p><p>There are a number of treatments available for gum
disease sufferers, each of which varies depending on the
severity of the condition. In order to determine the
treatment modality that best meets your needs, your dentist
will evaluate the extent of the damage caused by gum disease
to develop a conservative initial plan. A dental hygiene
evaluation will determine if plaque (soft deposits on the
tooth) is being removed on a daily basis.</p><p>Next, dental tartar (also known as calculus) must be removed
through a professional cleaning, and sometimes through the
additional procedures of deep scaling and root planing. A
local anesthetic may be administered during these
procedures. Your dentist may also administer antibiotics to
treat bacteria housed in the pocketed areas of the gum, and
recommend a medicated mouthwash to be used as a regular part
of your home regimen.</p></div></section><section class="wrapper alt style2"><div class="inner"><h3 class="major">Restorative Dentistry</h3><p><span class="image right"><img src="images/restorative-dentistry.jpg"></span>Restorative dentistry is the process of restoring the function of the tooth by replacing missing or
damaged tooth structure. Restorations are classified as either:</p><h4>Direct:</h4><p>The restoration is fabricated, or made inside the
mouth, ie. composite or amalgam fillings.</p><h4>Indirect:</h4><p>The restoration is made outside of the mouth, ie.
dentures, crowns, bridges, implants, inlays, onlays.
Common materials used are acrylic, chrome, gold,
porcelain, and zirconia.</p><h4>Dentures</h4><p>A denture is a removable replacement for missing teeth
and surrounding tissues. Two types of denture are available;
complete and partial dentures. Complete dentures are used
when all the teeth are missing while partial dentures are
used when some natural teeth remain.</p><span class="image right"><img src="images/full-dentures.jpg"></span><h5>Full Dentures</h5><p>Full dentures can be either &quot;conventional&quot; or
&quot;immediate.&quot; A conventional denture is made after
teeth have been removed and the gum area has healed or where 
teeth have already been missing for some time. The design 
and manufacture process can take 4-8 weeks before the denutre
is ready for placement in the mouth. Unlike conventional 
dentures, immediate dentures are made in advance and can
be positioned as soon as the teeth are removed. As a result,
the wearer does not have to be without teeth during the
healing period. However, bones and gums shrink over time,
especially during the healing period following tooth
removal. Therefore a disadvantage of immediate dentures
compared with conventional dentures is that they require
more adjustments to fit properly during the healing process
and generally should only be considered a temporary solution
until conventional dentures can be made.</p><span class="image right"><img src="images/partial-dentures.jpg"></span><h5>Partial Dentures</h5><p>A removable partial denture consists of
replacement teeth attached to a pink or gum-colored plastic
base, which is sometimes connected by metal framework that
holds the denture in place in the mouth. Partial dentures
are used when one or more natural teeth remain in the upper
or lower jaw. A partial denture can be immediate or
conventional also.</p><h4 class="clear">Crown and Bridgework</h4><span class="image right"><img src="images/dental-crown.jpg"></span><h5>Dental Crown</h5><p>Whether a dental crown is needed for tooth cracks, excessive
tooth decay, damaged tooth protection, teeth grinding,
missing teeth, need for beautification or an improper bite
resulting from the natural wear and tear produced by
aging, dental crowns of today can satisfy your functional
and aesthetic needs. The purpose of a dental crown is to
encompass and protect a needy tooth with a custom-designed
tooth material, much like a fitted cap.</p><h5>Dental Bridges</h5><span class="image right"><img src="images/dental-bridge.jpg"></span><p>Dental bridges are used to replace missing teeth that
would otherwise adversely affect your mouth. The negative
effects of one or more missing teeth can include the
shifting of other teeth to accommodate for the open space, a
change in the bite that may affect your ability to eat, and
an increased risk for periodontal disease and tooth decay. A
fixed bridge replaces one or more teeth by placing crowns on
the teeth on either side of the space and attaching
artificial teeth to them. This bridge is then cemented into
place. Not only does a dental bridge fill in the spaces created by
missing teeth, it prevents other teeth from changing
position.</p></div></section><section class="wrapper style3"><div class="inner"><h3 class="major">Cosmetic Dentistry</h3><p><span class="image left"><img src="images/cosmetic-dentistry.jpg"></span>While traditional dentistry focuses on oral hygiene and
preventing, diagnosing and treating oral disease, cosmetic
dentistry focuses on improving the appearance of a person&apos;s
teeth, mouth and smile. In other words general dentistry
addresses dental problems that require necessary treatment,
whereas cosmetic dentistry provides elective &ndash; or desired &ndash;
treatments or services.</p><p>Today, dental fillings may fall into the category of
cosmetic dentistry, because you can select fillings made of
porcelain or composite materials that closely match the
colour of your teeth, thus maintaining the natural
appearance of your teeth and smile.</p><h4 class="clear" style="clear:left">Composite Bonding And Filling</h4><span class="image right"><img src="images/composite-bonding.jpg"></span><p>Chipped, broken, discoloured or decayed teeth may be
repaired or have their appearance corrected using a filling
procedure called composite bonding. A dental composite
filling material with the look of enamel and dentin is applied into
the cavity or onto the surface of a tooth, where it is then
sculpted into shape, contoured and hardened with a
high-intensity light. The result is a restoration that
blends with the remainder of the surrounding tooth structure
and the rest of your natural teeth to create a healthy,
bright smile.</p><h4 class="clear">Teeth Whitening</h4><span class="image right"><img src="images/teeth-whitening.jpg"></span><p class="clearfix">Teeth whitening is perhaps the most commonly recommended
cosmetic dentistry procedure. Teeth are often stained from
smoking, food, drink (coffee, tea or red wine) or poor oral
hygiene. Bleaching the teeth can enhance the appearance of
your smile. We provide home whitening kits which include
trays made to fit your mouth precisely and whitening gel.</p><h4 class="clear">Dental Veneers</h4><span class="image right"><img src="images/dental-veneers.jpg"></span><p style="min-height: 170px">Composite or laminate veneers are adhesively
bonded to the surface of a tooth to correct and repair chips
and cracks will improve a worn appearance or severe tooth
discolouration.</p></div></section><section class="wrapper alt style4"><div class="inner"><h3 class="major">Oral Surgery</h3><h4>Tooth Extractions</h4><p>Tooth extraction is the removal of a tooth from its
socket in the bone. Although permanent teeth were meant to
last a lifetime, there are a number of reasons why having a
tooth pulled in adulthood is sometimes necessary. A very
common reason involves a tooth that is too badly damaged,
from trauma or decay, to be repaired. Other reasons include
overcrowding, orthodontics, infection and gum disease.</p><p>There are two types of extractions, simple and complex. In a
simple extraction, the tooth is loosened with an instrument called
an elevator. Then, a forceps is used to remove the tooth. A
surgical extraction is a more complex procedure. It is used if a
tooth may have broken off at the gum line or has not come into the
mouth yet. A small incision must be made into your gum and some of
the bone around the tooth removed or the tooth cut in half in
order to extract it. Sometimes it is necessary for surgical
extractions to be performed by specialist oral surgeons.</p></div></section><section class="wrapper style2"><div class="inner"><h3 class="major">Specialist Dentistry</h3><p>For more complicated dental procedures such as orthodontics, root
